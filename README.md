## The Chaos of My Mind

Welcome to my digital garden. My name's Patrick. I'm a tech journalist and fantasy author. 

This garden exists as a glimpse into my mind, into the ways I approach new subjects, niche interests, and more. Of course, not all of my content appears here â€” much of it is private, but I aim to regularly publish new updates. Think of it like a modern version of an old Xanga or Livejournal, if you happen to remember those.
