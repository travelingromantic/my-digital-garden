This garden exists as a glimpse into my mind, into the ways I approach new subjects, niche interests, and more. Of course, not all of my content appears here — much of it is private, but I aim to regularly publish new updates. Think of it like a modern version of an old Xanga or Livejournal, if you happen to remember those.
